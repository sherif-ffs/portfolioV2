                      Wine is quickly becoming our parents beverage, and being our parents
                       anything is almost always the kiss of death for consumer products. 
                       Millennials aren’t yet embracing wine consumption as many had predicted, 
                       and with baby boomers moving into retirement 
                       this is bad news for the wine industry as a whole.

                  <p>We interviewed more than 40 people between the ages of 21 and 35. We found that:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>People will rarely spend more than $25 dollars on a bottle of wine</li>
                      <li>Price is the number one factor when someone is considering whether or not to go to a wine event</li>
                      <li>More than half of the interviewees said they are interested in going to a winery or wine event</li>

                    <h1>Ideation</h1>
                    <p>With our research findings and personas in mind, I invited our researchers and the other designer to brainstorm solutions together. I encouraged them to come up with as many ideas as possible without considering development or project scope at this stage.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/wine/ideation.svg" alt="">
                    <p>We then went through the ideas and discussed their implementation feasibility. For example, allowing users to buy wine through the app would be ideal, but building out this feature would be too complex without some sort of API. Therefore allowing users to save and keep track of wines they like would be the best compromise.</p>
                    <p>Eventually we settled on the following core functionalities</p>

                    <p>Users did not have a consistent way to quickly visualize and track their wines and badges</p>
                    <h1>Feature Changes</h1>
                    <p>Because of this we decided to create a discover page, where users could search for events or get events recommended to them directly</p>
                    <p>We also added a dashboard feature to the profile page, where the total number of the users badges and wines would be there to see.</p>

               <h1>User Testing Process</h1>
               <p>With the goals I had for this iteration in mind, I moderated user feedback sessions with 10 users with different attitudes towards wine and different levels of interest in attending wine events in Hudson Valley (the wine region I used in my prototype). Here's a brief overview of the process:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Introduce and explain the project</li>
                   <li>Give the users a set of tasks, and let users use the app while thinking aloud</li>
                   <li>Ask follow up questions and gather feedback</li>
                   <li>Had users fill out a questionnaire</li>
               </ul>
               <p><b>Users were asked to rate their response on a scale from 1-5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest) and then explain why they answered the way they did</b></p>

                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>I was able to gain a lot of positive from the prototype and the questionnaire, both from answers to the questionnaire and comments on what users thought could improve the design.</p>
